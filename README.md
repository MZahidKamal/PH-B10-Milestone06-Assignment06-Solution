# 🐾 Peddy :: A Pet Adoption Website

Welcome to the **Pet Adoption Website**! This is an interactive web application designed to help you find and adopt your new best friend. The website provides a smooth user experience, dynamically loading pet information and allowing users to explore various categories and details of pets available for adoption. This project allows users to browse through different categories of pets, view detailed information about each pet, and even adopt them through a simple and engaging interface. The site is designed to be user-friendly, with features that make finding and adopting a pet a delightful experience.

## ✨ 5 Key Features

Here are the top 5 features of the Pet Adoption Website:

1. **Dynamic Pet Categories:** The website dynamically creates buttons for each pet category based on the data fetched from an API, providing a smooth browsing experience.

2. **Interactive Pet Cards:** Displays detailed information about each pet, including name, price, and other relevant details, using dynamically generated pet cards.

3. **Sorting Functionality:** Allows users to sort pets by price in descending order, making it easier to find a pet that fits their budget.

4. **Adoption Process Simulation:** Includes an interactive adoption process with countdown timers and modals that simulate adopting a pet.

5. **Pet Gallery:** Users can like their favorite pets, and the selected pets will be saved to a gallery on the right side of the screen for quick access.

## 🛠️ ES6 Features Used

The project makes extensive use of modern JavaScript (ES6) features to create a cleaner and more efficient codebase. Some of the key ES6 features used include:

- **Arrow Functions:** For concise syntax and to maintain the correct context of `this`.
- **Promises and Async/Await:** To handle asynchronous API calls in a clean and readable manner.
- **Template Literals:** For easy string concatenation and multi-line strings.
- **Let and Const:** To declare variables with appropriate scope and immutability.
